<h2>🧠 How It Works</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Random Number:</b> Generated between <code>0</code> and <code>1000</code> using <code>randint()</code>.</li>
  <li><b>Timer:</b> Starts when you begin guessing and stops when you find the correct number.</li>
  <li><b>Leaderboard:</b> Each player's time is stored in a JSON file and displayed in sorted order.</li>
  <li><b>Reset:</b> You can clear all scores at any time via the main menu.</li>
  <li><b>Cross-platform:</b> Works on both Windows and macOS/Linux (auto-detects <code>cls</code> or <code>clear</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>💻 Technologies Used</h2>

| Library | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| <code>random</code> | Generates the random number for guessing |
| <code>time</code> | Controls timers and countdowns |
| <code>os</code> | Clears the console screen dynamically |
| <code>sys</code> | Manages text and output control |
| <code>json</code> | Saves and loads player scores persistently |

---

<h2>📊 Leaderboard System</h2>

<p>Scores are stored inside <code>score_board.json</code> as a simple JSON structure:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "scores": [
    {"player": "SHEIKH", "time": "01:23"},
    {"player": "ALICE", "time": "02:15"}
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>The leaderboard automatically sorts players by the fastest completion time.</p>
